# Pipedrive test task

Unfortunately, due to time constraints, this code appears to be somewhat unfinished. 
While working on such a project, I would like to add also the following features: connect a database for storing data regardless of the cache's lifetime and add tests. 
Additionally, for user convenience, I would like to include the ability to search, add custom photos and edit person data. And improve UI of course, this UI seems to be not so nice and convinient.

As for the task itself, I think it would be helpful to specify which version of the API should be used, as v1 differs quite a bit from v2. 
Another nice thing to know is minimum iOS version, because if it will be required to support old iOS apps, before iOS 16, most probably using SwiftUI is not a good idea.
Also, the API documentation seems to be lacking in completeness: thereâ€™s no information about which fields are optional and which are required. 
This might be because the API is not designed for mobile developers and is likely intended to be interacted with using JS.
